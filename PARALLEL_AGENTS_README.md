# LinkedIn Post Generation Pipeline - Parallel Agents

## Overview

This enhanced LinkedIn Post Generation Pipeline now includes parallel agents that work simultaneously to provide hashtags and visual recommendations after the post content is finalized.

## Architecture

### New Pipeline Flow
1. **InitialPostGenerator** - Creates the first draft of the LinkedIn post
2. **PostEnhancementParallel** - Runs two agents simultaneously on the initial post:
   - **HashtagGenerator** - Analyzes content to suggest relevant hashtags for better reach
   - **VisualFinder** - Suggests relevant visual content and search strategies
3. **PostRefinementLoop** - Iteratively reviews and refines the post until quality standards are met
   - PostReviewer - Evaluates post quality and provides feedback
   - PostRefiner - Applies feedback to improve the post

## New Agents

### HashtagGenerator
- **Purpose**: Generate 8-15 relevant hashtags for the LinkedIn post
- **Input**: Final post content + original user input
- **Strategy**: Mix of popular and niche hashtags across industry-specific, trending, and engagement categories
- **Output**: Formatted hashtag string ready for use

### VisualFinder
- **Purpose**: Suggest relevant professional visuals to enhance the post
- **Input**: Initial post content
- **Strategy**: Analyzes content to provide specific visual search recommendations and strategies
- **Output**: Structured visual recommendations with search terms and sources (no direct tool integration due to function calling limitations)

## Benefits of Parallel Architecture

1. **Efficiency**: Hashtag and visual finding happen simultaneously after the initial post, reducing total pipeline time
2. **Early Enhancement**: Parallel agents work on the initial post, providing context for the refinement process
3. **Independence**: Each enhancement agent works independently on the initial content
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more parallel enhancement agents in the future
5. **Modularity**: Each agent has focused responsibilities and can be updated independently
6. **No Function Calling Issues**: Simplified approach that avoids Google ADK function calling limitations

## Usage

The pipeline now provides three key outputs:
- `current_post` - The refined LinkedIn post content
- `suggested_hashtags` - Relevant hashtags for better reach
- `visual_recommendations` - Professional visual suggestions
